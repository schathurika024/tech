@SpringBootApplication which sets up component scanning and autoconfiguration.

Inversion of Control means you don’t create objects yourself — Spring creates them and gives them to you.IoC means Spring is in charge of creating and giving you the objects your application needs, instead of you creating them manually.

Dependency Injection means a class gets the objects it needs from Spring instead of creating them itself.

DI means Spring gives your class the required objects (dependencies) instead of your class creating them.

@Autowired automatically injects the required dependency into your class so you don’t have to create it yourself.
